## RAREfest 2020 organised by Cambridge Rare Disease Network

Anyone can be affected by a rare disease. In fact, the award-winning campaign by [Takeda](https://iamnumber17.geneticalliance.org.uk) illustrated that 1 in 17 people are affected. Whilst rare diseases are
rare - they are (collectively) not uncommon and they can be caused by completely unpredicted new changes in the DNA.
Let's chat AI, gene therapies, the story of impressive entrepreneur Onno Faber and the little-known genetics of bodyweight. 

### MORNING SESSION: AI and Rare Diseases

Let's start off first with the statistics: 7,000 rare diseases, 95% without treatment, 400m patients world-wide, 50% children (Credit: Healx ppt.). 

The morning panel composed of Simone Manso from Healx, Rudy Benfredj from Mendelian and Maria Picone from TREND Community discussed powering up Rare Diseases
with Artificial Intelligence. A take-home message was that human and artificial intelligence can work hand-in-hand to diagnose early and at-scale. 

Rare diseases are notorious for their 'diagnostic odyssey', meaning many years (sometimes decades) until patients receive an accurate diagnosis. The emotional toll 
of this journey on patients and family should not be underestimated, with each diagnosis oftentimes carrying a different disease-course and life expectancy. 

Artificial intelligence can be applied to pick up patterns in patient clinical histories that suggest the possibility of particular rare diseases. This is exactly
what the company Mendelian is offering doctors as it integrates into the NHS. To paraphrase Rudy Benfredj, "doctors welcome a nudge from the system suggesting 
that their patient may have a rare disease that the doctor is not aware of. They use this information to either say, 'thanks, I'll look into that further' 
or 'thanks, but I know my patient well and I am confident that we can rule out this disease'".

Simone Manso from Healx raised something along these lines, "whilst AI has powerful computing to spot patterns, patient and expert input is still crucial". It's 
best to think of AI as an aid that can aggregrate masses of data to generate hypotheses and present them to the experts. Patients can really help by offering their
experiences to fine tune information that is fed into the AI systems. 

Maria Picone from TREND Community works closely with patient groups. She uses social listening (the process of tracking mentions of certain words on social media)
in patient support groups to pick up areas of discussion, concern and unmet need within rare disease communities. Even more than that, Maria uses Natural Language 
Processing and Machine Learning to analyse data from patient groups and generate insight reports that can be presented to stakeholders in rare diseases.

### AFTERNOON SESSION: Gene Therapies

The afternoon panel consisted of Professor Bobby Gaspar of Orchard Therapeutics, Georgina Morton of Archangel MLD Trust and Professor Tim Cox from the University 
of Cambridge discussing gene therapies in rare diseases. 

Each rare disease is different but many are monogenic (caused by a single gene) which makes them candidates for gene therapy. Gene therapy is a potentially 
curative change to a disease gene, oftentimes in a single dose. This can come at a high cost and the panel explored why this can really be justified. 

The session began with former TV presenter Georgina Morton describing the diagnostic journey she experienced with her daughter who has metachromatic leukodystrophy 
(MLD). The prognosis for Georgina's daughter was poor, with many children with this disease suffering fast deterioration of their motor functions and nervous
system. Georgina's daughter was enrolled into a gene therapy clinical trial in Milan which successfully halted the progression of MLD. The disease course of MLD
highlights that a matter of months can be the difference between life or death in rare diseases. 

Professor Bobby Gaspar researches and develops gene therapies, working with the patient families at the centre. Core to his work is identifying the right cell and
right gene to improve patient outcomes. Gene therapy is a toolbox with various applications - in the case of immunodeficiences it can be used to build up an
immune system. In the case of MLD it is used to halt disease progression and preserve the remaining neurological function.

All panel members moderated by Professor Tim Cox agreed that early diagnosis accompanied by gene therapy promises the best outlook for rare disease patients. There
was emphasis on the need to develop newborn screening in the UK, with other European countries and the USA being far ahead of the game compared to Britain in terms
of screening for a wider breadth of diseases. Another point that the panel agreed on was the need for a different model of economic evaluation of gene therapies. 
Whilst the upfront cost is high (reaching millions for a single dose), this cost and benefit to patient lives is dwarfed by the comparative financial and human cost
of a lifetime of full-time care and hospital visits. 

### AFTERNOON SESSION: Onno Faber - Entrepreneur in rare diseases, moderated by Dr Jason Mellad 

Before the session started it was suggested that we watch Onno Faber's TEDx talk from San Francisco, ['We'll all be Patients One Day'](https://www.ted.com/talks/onno_faber_we_ll_all_be_patients_one_day_jan_2019), a great 15-minute intro into
the life and motivations of the Dutch entrepeneur. Onno sees himself as a problem-solver, who was thrust into the world of rare disease by his own personal 
diagnosis of tumours on the brain and spinal cord. 

A computer coder from a young age, Onno made it to silicon valley, starting up several companies. When the diagnosis arrived into his life, he had his tumour 
sequenced and stored the genomic data on his hard-drive. In true problem-solving fashion, Onno acted on the talent surrounding him and gathered 400 people
to 'hack' his DNA to generate insights about the tumour sequence. The process led to the idea that a drug marketed for breast cancer might work on Onno's condition.
On top of that, it highlighted how difficult patient data was to access and share. Cue the creation of two new companies: AllStripes and Rarebase. 

In recognition of the fact that more genomic data drives research, Onno created AllStripes to facilitate clinical data sharing, with the patient in the driving 
seat. Rarebase, on the other hand, looks at identifying opportunities for repurposing drugs that are currently on the market. The best chance for rare disease 
patients is if they can pick up a drug that is already authorised and for it to work on their disease. Generation of new drugs takes time and is not always
commercially attractive for pharmaceutical companies. Rarebase does also look at collaboration with patient groups and foundations to generate funding from these 
sources as a gateway into new personalised therapies. Both Onno and Jason agreed that repurposing of drugs already on the market is a different funding model that
needs to be looked at for rare diseases, with Jason highlighting that looking for a high benefit-low toxicity drug profile may be a journey of trial and error. 

Jason chipped in to add to the notion that rare diseases can sneak up on anyone - whilst he is not a rare disease sufferer, genomic sequencing during family 
planning revealed that he was unexpectedly a carrier of autosomal recessive conidtions. The take-home message was that rare diseases can affect anyone but that 
there is plenty of reasons for affected people to hope for a treatments, even if those are not immediately obvious. 

### AFTERNOON SESSION: Is obesity a choice?

The stimulating and thought-provoking discussion 'is obesity a choice?' was delivered by Dr Giles Yeo MBE (a familiar face, having been my personal tutor during
Master's studies). Giles is known for his ability to engage the audience. 

We all understand the basic physics of _how_ weight is put on and lost, ie. energy input versus output, but we don't speak a lot about _why_ bodyweight is 
different amongst individuals. Giles explained how rare diseases of obesity gave him insight into the genetic and neural variations at play in all of us. The 
session started off by playing out a scenario. On a Monday morning someone brings cookies into the meeting, and this tends to generate 4 types of responses: (1)
the person who notices and picks one up to eat, (2) the person who notices, holds back, but longs so hard for the cookie that they miss the content of the meeting,
(3) the person that couldn't care less about cookies arriving and (4) the person who doesn't even realise they've already eaten a cookie or two. 

Genetic variations are responsible for 75% of bodyweight. In extreme scenarios of childhood obesity, the fat sensing pathways responsible for signalling to the 
brain that the body has fat and will not starve are not functioning properly. These obese children are driven by a biology (lack of leptin) that believes they are
in extreme starvation mode, leading to attempts to eat almost anything including frozen food. An extremely awful reality is that these children are sometimes taken
away from their families by social services citing abuse, when modern science shows that these eating behaviours are a powerful biological disease.

How does this feed into the general population? Twin studies have revealed that the same pathways that drive pathological eating behaviour in the extremes of
disease, also contain subtle variations in the general population. Each instance of eating is indeed a binary decision of yes/no, however genetic factors can make
individuals slightly more likely to say yes. This is more important than it initially seems since weight is not put on overnight and life contains thousands of 
feeding decisions over a lifetime. Over thousands of eating decisions, a 5% increased likelihood of saying yes can be the cause of obesity. 

The phenomenon is not unique to humans, with research from Cambridge showing that variation in similar pathways can explain why Labradors are a particularly 
food-motivated breed!
