### MORNING SESSION: AI and Rare Diseases

Let's start off first with the statistics: 7,000 rare diseases, 95% without treatment, 400m patients world-wide, 50% children. (Credit: Healx ppt.)

The morning panel composed of Simone Manso from Healx, Rudy Benfredj from Mendelian and Maria Picone from TREND Community discussed powering up Rare Diseases
with Artificial Intelligence. A take-home message was that human and artificial intelligence can work hand-in-hand to diagnose early and at-scale. 

Rare diseases are notorious for their 'diagnostic odyssey', meaning many years (sometimes decades) until patients receive an accurate diagnosis. The emotional toll 
of this journey on patients and family should not be underestimated, with each diagnosis oftentimes carrying a different disease-course and life expectancy. 
Furthermore, a staggering 1 in 17 people are affected by rare diseases, meaning that whilst they are rare - they are (collectively) not uncommon!

Artificial intelligence can be applied to pick up patterns in patient clinical histories that suggest the possibility of particular rare diseases. This is exactly
what the company Mendelian is offering doctors as it integrates into the NHS. To paraphrase Rudy Benfredj, "doctors welcome a nudge from the system suggesting 
that their patient may have a rare disease that the doctor is not aware of. They use this information to either say, 'thanks, I'll look into that further' 
or 'thanks, but I know my patient well and I am confident that we can rule out this disease'".

Simone Manso from Healx raised something along these lines, "whilst AI has powerful computing to spot patterns, patient and expert input is still crucial". It's 
best to think of AI as an aid that can aggregrate masses of data to generate hypotheses and present them to the experts. Patients can really help by offering their
experiences to fine tune information that is fed into the AI systems. 

Maria Picone from TREND Community works closely with patient groups. She uses social listening (the process of tracking mentions of certain words on social media)
in patient support groups to pick up areas of discussion, concern and unmet need within rare disease communities. Even more than that, Maria uses Natural Language 
Processing and Machine Learning to analyse data from patient groups and generate insight reports that can be presented to stakeholders in rare diseases.

AFTERNOON SESSION: Gene Therapies

The afternoon panel consisted of Professor Bobby Gaspar of Orchard Therapeutics, Georgina Morton of Archangel MLD Trust and Professor Tim Cox from the University 
of Cambridge discussing gene therapies in rare diseases.
